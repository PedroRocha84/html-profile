            <h2>Sumary</h2>
            <p>I'm Pedro Rocha i have 38 years old and i am a fan of new technology and developing!</p>
            <p>My journey started in 1994, where i started to learn Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS. This was a moment where i noticed that i love to know: how things works; how things are made of.
                <ul>
                    <li>In 2001 i built my first aplication, using Visual Basic language, for a company called <a href="http://www.sovideo.pt">Sovideo</a> that was focused on setting windows permissions to increse system security. This software was deployed over +500 notebooks, in my country. Used at that time for Cyber Cafe's, reducing time spent on configurations, maintenance.</li>
                    <li>In 2011 i decided to try out IT Support and was my first job as a freelancer during 14 years, ending up at 2017.</li>
                    <li>In 2010 i finished my Master in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering in Porto University, never lost the eye of developing during this time, i did my first Chess Game using Visual Basic.</li> 
                    <li>In 2010 i started my full time job as Product Engineer and also member of World Class Manufacturing and my continuous improvement skill arised.</li>
                    <li>Until 2014th i led a multi-disciplinary team of Engineers, where our focus were applying continuous improvement concepts to the current company process, an amazing journey</li>
                    <li>In 2017 a new chapter began in a Fashion Company where i was able to grow another skill, People and Team Management.</li>                
                </ul>
            </p>
          
            <p>Most of you are at this stage thinking "Why to learn Web development?" it's for me a easy answer, we don't control our future, but we control what we can learn! For me learning something new, a side of my Family and Travel, is the most important thing for me that motivates me!
